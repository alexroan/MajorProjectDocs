\chapter{Design}

You should concentrate on the more important aspects of the design. It is essential that an overview is presented before going into detail. As well as describing the design adopted it must also explain what other designs were considered and why they were rejected.

The design should describe what you expected to do, and might also explain areas that you had to revise after some investigation.

Typically, for an object-oriented design, the discussion will focus on the choice of objects and classes and the allocation of methods to classes. The use made of reusable components should be described and their source referenced. Particularly important decisions concerning data structures usually affect the architecture of a system and so should be described here.

How much material you include on detailed design and implementation will depend very much on the nature of the project. It should not be padded out. Think about the significant aspects of your system. For example, describe the design of the user interface if it is a critical aspect of your system, or provide detail about methods and data structures that are not trivial. Do not spend time on long lists of trivial items and repetitive descriptions. If in doubt about what is appropriate, speak to your supervisor.
 
You should also identify any support tools that you used. You should discuss your choice of implementation tools - programming language, compilers, database management system, program development environment, etc.

Some example sub-sections may be as follows, but the specific sections are for you to define. 

\section{Overview}
\section{Technologies}
	\subsection{PHP}
		A few languages were considered for this project, these include Ruby, Python and Perl. Perl was the first to be discarded. This was mainly due to its performance and usability when used in an Object Oriented fashion. Ruby with Ruby of Rails provides a very stable platform to develop upon, but does not quite have the flexibility that I intended to yield in the development. The final decision came between Python and PHP. Python is a clean language with very good performance and is easy to use. However, the flexibility that PHP provides when developing web pages and its good Object Oriented capabilities meant that I sided with it even though its performance may not be as good as Python.
		
	\subsection{JQuery}
		JQuery is featured on the website as a means of displaying certain features. Graphical maps generated by Google Directions \cite{google_directions_api} service are retrieved and displayed using JQuery. It is also used on the messages page of the site.	
			
	\subsection{PostgreSQL Database}
	Using an Object Relational database management system is the most efficient method of storing dynamic for websites. The PSQL database is handled by the object oriented PHP application that is used by the website.
	
	\subsection{Github}
		Github \cite{github} version control web hosting was chosen as the desired.
		 
\section{Overall Architecture}
	\subsection{Overview}
	
	\subsection{Method}
	\subsection{Structure of Database Controller}
		The Database Controller is the name given to the object oriented structure of PHP classes used to control data flow to and from the database. For each of the main tables in the database, there is a corresponding PHP class with the same name: Hitch\textunderscore Request, Journey, Journey\textunderscore Step, Message and Person. The classes that model these tables have attributes matching those of the table attributes, and contain the 4 methods Create, Load, Update, Delete; following the CRUD persistent storage technique. The Create methods in each of the classes uses attribute values to create a new value in the corresponding database table. The Update methods update the related value already in the corresponding table using the attributes in the class object. The Load method loads the attributes to the class object from the corresponding table in the database using the primary key as a parameter. The Delete method simply deletes the related value from the corresponding table in the database using it's primary key stored in the class object's attributes. Upon instantiating each of the model class objects, a non-compulsory parameter may be parsed to the constructor as the primary key to that table. If something is parsed in this parameter, the constructor will call the Load method, which attempts to populate the class object's attributes with values from the corresponding table using the parameter as the primary key.
		
		Each of the table model classes are utilized by controller classes.
