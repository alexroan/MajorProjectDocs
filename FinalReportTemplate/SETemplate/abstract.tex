\end{center}

In the world we live in today, many people need to travel long distances across the UK. Often, these people do not have access to their own mode of transportation. With public transport prices in the UK rising steadily, making these journeys could be quite costly. 

This project aims to bring the drivers of vehicles together with others who have little choice of transportation, to reduce the cost of travelling across the country. It provides a platform in which drivers can share journeys for passengers to hitch in the same or similar directions.
