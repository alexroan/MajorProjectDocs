\chapter{Background \& Objectives}

This section should discuss your preparation for the project, including background reading, your analysis of the problem and the process or method you have followed to help structure your work.  It is likely that you will reuse part of your outline project specification, but at this point in the project you should have more to talk about. 

\textbf{Note}: 

\begin{itemize}
   \item All of the sections and text in this example are for illustration purposes. The main Chapters are a good starting point, but the content and actual sections that you include are likely to be different.
   
   \item Look at the document on the Structure of the Final Report for additional guidance.

\section{Background}
\subsection{Overview}
As a student studying in a university away from home, I have often needed to travel back home during the holidays or on weekends. My motivation for this project comes from the requirement that many people have to travel frequently from one place to another. 

I have always driven to Cardiff from Aberystwyth and back during the holidays in a car with 4 spare seats. If there was some way I could offer those spare seats to other students or people travelling in the same or similar direction the cost of fuel could be split, meaning a cheaper mode of transport.

With the cost of public transport soaring ever higher\cite{gov_public_transport_doc}, travelling around the country is becoming a more expensive task year after year. Not only are Bus and Train prices increasing, but petrol prices have sky rocketed in the last century\cite{guardian_fuel_prices} as well. This website aims to bring people together who are travelling in similar directions to save on the cost of fuel instead of having to pay a full train fair or travelling alone. 

A one way train ticket between Aberystwyth and Cardiff costs around \pounds 54.80\cite{trainline_aber_cardiff_price}, a journey that in a small car can cost as little as \pounds 20 in fuel. If That journey is shared between a driver and a passenger who would otherwise have no option but to take the train, they would each only need to pay \pounds 10 for the journey. The driver saves \pounds 10 on their journey, and the passenger saves a massive \pounds 44.80 on theirs!


\subsection{Example Use Case}
	Upon opening the home page, the user will be confronted with the option of either registering, or logging in using existing details. Either action done successfully will log the user in.
	
	Once logged in, the user is taken to their home page, which displays predicted journeys that the site thinks the user might be interested in using their preferences. From this page, they can access all features within the site, which include:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 'My Activity' - Information about upcoming rides and hitches related to the user. The ability to accept or decline hitch requests for their journeys.
		\item 'Messages' - Messages to and from other users.
		\item 'My Profile' - Personal details about the user, available for editing.
		\item 'Find a Journey' - A search page used to search for journeys from one location to another.
		\item 'Post Journey' - The page used to post new journeys that the user will be partaking in.		
	\end{itemize}
	
	When a user posts a journey from location A to location B using the 'Post Journey' page, it will display a map route which needs to be accepted by the user. Once this is accepted, the journey will be entered into the database, where it will be returned in other users searches if the parameters match the details of the journey.
	
	If another user requests to hitch a ride on the journey, the driver will be prompted in the 'My Activity' page, and will have the option of accepting or declining the hitch request. 
	
	The hitch request could be from location A to location B, but it could also be from location A to a new location C. Similarly it could be from location C to location B, or even location C to location D. It is up to the driver to accept or decline the hitch request, depending on how it changes the route that the driver takes.
	
	If the driver accepts this new hitcher, the route will be altered if necessary to include the new pickup / drop off points and saved into the database with one of the spare spaces now filled.
	 
\subsection{Existing Services}
	There are existing websites that offer the same sort of carpooling service. The leading services are Carpooling.com \cite{carpooling_com} and BlaBlaCar \cite{blabla}. These sites provide a platform for people to offer rides to other people needing to travel in similar directions.
	
	\begin{description}
	\item[Carpooling.com] This is a worldwide service which offers registered users the chance to share rides to other users

\section{Analysis}
Taking into account the problem and what you learned from the background work, what was your analysis of the problem? How did your analysis help to decompose the problem into the main tasks that you would undertake? Were there alternative approaches? Why did you choose one approach compared to the alternatives? 

There should be a clear statement of the objectives of the work, which you will evaluate at the end of the work. 

In most cases, the agreed objectives or requirements will be the result of a compromise between what would ideally have been produced and what was felt to be possible in the time available. A discussion of the process of arriving at the final list is usually appropriate.

\subsection{Original Goals}
	The original goals of the project were to produce an online service that enables people to share journeys with people who are looking to travel to and from similar locations or locations along the route of the driver. 
	
	This would enable the users to reduce the cost of the journeys by sharing the cost of fuel.
	
\subsection{Requirements}
Enable users to:
\begin{itemize}
\item FR1 - Register to the site
\item FR2 - Log in if an existing member
\item FR3 - Post new journeys  to the site, offering spare spaces
\item FR4 - Search for a journey between two locations
\item FR5 - Request to join a journey offered by another user
\item FR6 - Accept a hitcher requesting to join a journey
\item FR7 - Decline a hitcher requesting to join a journey
\item FR8 - Suggest journeys depending on preferences
\item FR9 - Cancel a journey
\item FR10 - Send messages to other users
\end{itemize}

\section{Process}

\subsection{Overview}

\subsection{Methodology}
I have chosen to use the Waterfall Model as the methodology for this project. The reason for this is that this project was of my own design, meaning that the requirements of it were known from the very beginning and were very unlikely to change. 
\subsection{Planning}

\subsection{Research}
The vast majority of this service depends on its ability to recognise, locate and route directions from an origin to a destination. It was clear from the beginning that either a routing algorithm was needed to be developed using real map data, or an existing or multiple existing APIs needed to be utilized to produce routing data that could be saved locally to the site's database for processing. 

The APIs that were looked into were the Google Directions API \cite{google_directions_api} and the Google Geocoding API.
