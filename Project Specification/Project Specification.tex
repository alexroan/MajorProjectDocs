\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to describe the prospective product in detail, outlining specific requirements that it must adhere to.

\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Journey - A proposed journey following a route between an origin and destination by a person.
\item Hitch - When a person joins a Journey by taking up a spare seat on a Journey.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Overview}
The purpose of the Online Carpooling Service is to provide drivers with the ability to post the details of prospective Journeys, enabling non-drivers to travel in the same direction by joining them on their Journey. The motivation for this project is to share the cost of the Journey amongst people who would have otherwise travelled using separate transport modes.


\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product Perspective}
\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
An API should be developed to control data flow to and from the database and will be the only method of performing actions on it. It should be developed in such a way that the website can easily exploit data within the database by calling upon specific procedures within the API via HTTP.
\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
Website shit
\subsection{User Characteristics}
People who sign up to the site will provide personal information which will be saved in the database. This personal information will aid the service in producing Journey and Hitch suggestions. 

The users accessing the site will use it to ...
\subsection{Product Functions}

Posting journeys etc...
